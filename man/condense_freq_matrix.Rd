\description{
Condense a spectral frequence data matrix
}
\details{
This function takes a numeric matrix, whose columns are
time, and rows are frequency, and bins columns and rows
to produce a smaller numeric matrix.

It imposes some rules to bin labels:
\itemize{
\item Columns are considered time, the label assigned to the
new time bins are typically the "max" value from each bin,
such that time "0.01" through "1.00" will be labeled "1.00",
to represent "the first second bin".
\item Rows are considered frequency, where each bin will be
labeled by the mean frequency. For example if frequencies
"6.75" through "7.25" are binned, the output should be "7.0"
which represents the central frequency of the binned values.
}

Also, bins at the edges have two options:
\enumerate{
\item "full" indicates the first bin will be full size, and all
bins will be equal to that size. This strategy makes sense for
time, so each time bin is the same duration.
\item "half" indicates the first bin will be half the width of
subsequent bins. This strategy makes sense for frequency, to
help preserve the frequency nearest the edge of the matrix.
The last bin will also be half the width of intermediate bins.
In this case the first bin is labeled by the first value, and
the last bin is labeled by the last value.
