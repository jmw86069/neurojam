\usage{
get_ephys_event_data(mat_l, channels, events = NULL,
  event_offset = NULL, event_start = 2, event_stop = 3,
  default_event_diff = 40, event_prestart = 4000,
  event_poststop = 4000, event_label = "Tone", event_grep = "^EV",
  attr_names = c("animal", "channel", "ts.step", "ts"),
  all_start_grep = "^Start", all_start_row = 2,
  all_start_fixed = NULL, verbose = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat_l}{\code{list} containing raw signal output from
\code{import_ephys_mat_1()} when importing a Matlab \code{.mat} file,
or from \code{get_animal_raw_data()} when retrieving raw signal
output from a database. It should contain \code{matrix} entries
whose names match argument \code{event_grep}, typically one
matrix with start values, and one matrix with stop values.}

\item{channels}{character vector of channel names with raw signal
data in \code{mat_l}.}

\item{events}{integer vector of events to retain, in order they
appear in the event start table. When \code{events} is \code{NULL}, then
all events are returned.}

\item{event_offset}{integer index to the list of event matrices
whose named matched \code{event_grep}, which contains event time
offset values, or NULL to use no offset values. Sometimes the
first event table contains an offset value to apply before
taking the event start and stop times.}

\item{event_start, event_stop}{integer index to the list of event
matrices whose named matched \code{event_grep}, which contains event
start and stop times. By default the second (2) and third (3)
matrices are used for start and stop times, respectively.}

\item{default_event_diff}{integer value with the default
time in seconds between event_start and event_stop values,
intended when data in event_stop is truncated. For example
when the event_start matrix has 3 rows, and the event_stop matrix
has 2 rows, the third row of event_stop is calculated by adding
\code{default_event_diff} to the third row of event_start.}

\item{event_prestart, event_poststop}{integer number of steps to
include before each event start, and after each event stop,
respectively.}

\item{event_label}{character value used to create a text label
for each event, where event is numbered starting from 1.}

\item{event_grep}{character pattern used to identify the names in
\code{mat_l} which represent numeric event matrices. The default is
expected to match \code{"EVT01"}, \code{"EVT02"}, \code{"EVT03"}, where the
\code{"EVT02"} contains event start values, and \code{"EVT03"} contains
event stop values.}

\item{attr_names}{character vector of attributes to include
within each event data matrix.}

\item{all_start_grep}{character pattern of the name in \code{mat_l}
containing the overall start offset position. The default
uses \code{mat_l$Start}.}

\item{all_start_row}{integer row number of the matrix defined
by \code{all_start_grep} to use as the overall start offset. The
start offset can be verified by using argument \code{verbose=TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{logical indicating whether to print verbose output.}

\item{...}{additional arguments are ignored.}
